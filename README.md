# 4D-Cat-Adoption-DB

This is my second project at 4D, Inc. It is a simple catalog application that shows a list of fictional kittens available for adoption at "Mini Cat Town". Kitten entries can be added, modified, or deleted in the application.

The application uses an in-memory database to store information on each of the kittens. Entity selection was used to display the list of kittens on the left sidebar, and in the main content section to the right, multiple text input boxes display all of the columns stored in the database.
